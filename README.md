
# TBSH - Typed Bash Shell

## The idea:
    The main idea for this project is to have some sort of strict type checking in bash.
    This would mean that all of your bash functions/commands/oneliners would still work mostly as intended 
    executed like you would execute any other script `./script.tbsh` 
    you instead have the tbsh scripting language instead of normal bash. This is more aimed at being mostly different to bash
    but not entirely removed.

## Where is this in development?

    This is really early in development I do not work on this super often. 
    Right now we are currently writing the lexing and parsing process for the lanauage
    This will likely be slow at the being as I am learning about the processes that go into make a language
    A lot of things are up for change.

## Where can I see the progress for this project?
    for now you can look at CHANGELOG.md
